As Nirupama, no analogy,
Filled with many qualities,
Black and white, very white,
Created by Vidhata. ... (1)

Smaller and larger,
After the erupted earth,
Decorated, surprisingly,
In the depths of Bashundhara. ... (2)

It used to be, during the rainy season,
Now cultivating various seasons,
As it turned out, her life today,
Pai farmerâ€™s paras. ... (3)

Different countries, different types,
The dish is made,
Holding her little body,
Filled with many qualities. ... (4)

Roof. In Odisha,
Talk about rubbing salt in my wounds - d'oh!
Millions of people, living at home,
Pleases the mind. ... (5)

In unspoken language, Thiri Thiri says,
Will love me
Health is a resource, you know, man,
Made me sad ... (6)

Full of life, in your body,
Never mind,
Compared to wine meat, did not compare
Dharabuke will be happy. ... (7)

Eat amish, you are strong,
I know you are,
You loved me as food,
Saying he will be healed. ... (8)

That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.
The world did,
Blessed be my life,
The people of the universe laughed. ... (9)

Says my seal, the sphere of life,
Open in front of you,
Knowing me, your own karin,
To cherish. ... (10)

Fungus Seal, in the third week,
Spread out white,
In the rays of the sun, you can wake up,
I play leela. ... (11)

I am spread all over the world,
No one is bigger than me
I am very old, counted in plants,
Hey, good morning. ... (12)

In many ways, sub, not edible,
But my life adds up,
In a big way, in the distribution of food,
Maybe I need her. ... (13)

It is in the ground, my bread is spread out,
No, I'm not.
There I am, in the world I am,
This world as long as it exists. ... (14)

This is the language of my heart,
That's the decent thing to do, and it should end there.
Which, of course, made the video an overnight sensation
She is my eternal greeting. ... (15)
